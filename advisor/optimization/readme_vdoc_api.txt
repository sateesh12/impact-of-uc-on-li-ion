Here are the instructions of what to do with the ZIP file:


Enclosed is the file with VisualDOC 2.0 MATLAB API:
vdoc_matlab_api.zip

You should place it inside the directory where
VisualDOC is installed.  Typically it is.

C:\Program Files\VRAND\VisualDOC2

Once in this directory unzip the attached file.
While unzipping it will place the following
files in different directories:

VDOC_(..).dll - into "bin" - API DLLs

vdoc_matlab_api.pdf - into "docs" - reference VisualDOC API
   manual in PDF format.

box_DOE.m - into "examples\matlab_api" - example of using
   VisualDOC MATLAB API functions.

box_RSA_discr.m - into "examples\matlab_api" - example of using
   VisualDOC MATLAB API functions.

DBError.h - into "include" - header file with description
   of error codes (not required for compilation)

defs.h -  into "include" - header file with various
   definitions (not required for compilation)


It is recommended that you look through the first
sections of documentation first. Before studying
the example.

The examples are:
1) Design of experiments of the box with fillets (rounded edges).
2) Response surface optimization of the same box. Discrete design
variables are used.
