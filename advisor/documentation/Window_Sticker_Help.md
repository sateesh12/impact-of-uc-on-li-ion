### Window Sticker

The Window Sticker feature provides the EPA-like fuel economy ratings
and annual fuel costs that a consumer would expect to see posted on the
window of a new car. The equations used to provide these results are as
follows,

City = FTP-75 cycle fuel economy \* 0.9

Highway = HWFET cycle fuel economy \* 0.78

Annual fuel cost = (0.55/City+0.45/Highway) \* annual mileage \* fuel
cost

The 0.9 and 0.78 correction factors are used by EPA to correlate the
results from dynomometer testing to on-road operation while the 0.55 and
0.45 weighting factors are used by EPA to correctly account for the
relative amounts of city and highway vehicle operation. See the [Fuel
Economy Guide](http://www.fueleconomy.gov/) for more information.

Assumptions:

fuel cost = \$1.65/gallon

annual mileage = 15000 miles/year
