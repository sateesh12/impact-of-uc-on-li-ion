<p>The Window Sticker feature provides the EPA-like fuel economy ratings and annual fuel costs that a consumer would expect to see posted on the window of a new car. The equations used to provide these results are as follows,</p>
<p>City = FTP-75 cycle fuel economy * 0.9</p>
<p>Highway = HWFET cycle fuel economy * 0.78</p>
<p>Annual fuel cost = (0.55/City+0.45/Highway) * annual mileage * fuel cost</p>
<p>The 0.9 and 0.78 correction factors are used by EPA to correlate the results from dynomometer testing to on-road operation while the 0.55 and 0.45 weighting factors are used by EPA to correctly account for the relative amounts of city and highway vehicle operation. See the <a href="http://www.fueleconomy.gov/">Fuel Economy Guide</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Assumptions:</p>
<p>fuel cost = $1.65/gallon</p>
<p>annual mileage = 15000 miles/year</p>
