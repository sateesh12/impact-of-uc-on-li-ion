**<font size="+1">Test Procedure Description</font>** \
The City Highway Test Procedure runs a cold start FTP-75 cycle and a
hot-start HWFET cycle.  If TEST\_CITY\_HWY\_HYBRID is selected then 2
complete UDDS cycles are run in place of the standard FTP-75.  Please
refer to [TEST\_FTP](test_ftp_procedure.html) documentation for the
reasons for this change. The results window then displays the individual
cycle results along with a combined fuel economy as calculated in the
following equation:

1/((.55/MPG\_city)+(.45/MPG\_Hwy))

The window sticker button will open a new window with the adjusted fuel
economy numbers that a consumer may see posted on the vehicle window at
the time of purchase.  For more information on the adjustment factors
see [Window Sticker](Window_Sticker_Help.html) help. \
