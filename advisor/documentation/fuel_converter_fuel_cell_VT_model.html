<h2 id="the-virginia-tech-vt-fuel-cell-system-model"><strong>The Virginia Tech (VT) fuel cell system model</strong></h2>
<p>This Proton Exchange Membrane (PEM) fuel cell system model was developed by Virginia Tech (VT) in collaboration with NREL in 2001/2002. The VT model is a semi-empirical model that accounts for the thermal management and water balance in the system. The model provides hot- and cold-start effects on vehicle fuel economy, power limitations due to temperature, and a water balance for reactant humidification. The system operates on pure hydrogen. </p>
<p>Figure 1 shows a schematic of the model. The relevant components are a compressor, reactant humidifiers, a fuel cell stack, a condenser and water separator, a pressure release device and a cooling circuit including a pump, water reservoir and radiator. </p>
<p>The inlet gases are humidified in separate humidifiers. The stack outlet gases are assumed to be fully saturated (i.e., RH = 100%). The cathode exhaust is cooled in the condenser where part of its water content is condensed out and recovered for reuse in the humidification process. The system operating pressure varies as a function of the fuel cell load.</p>

<h4 id="general-model-overview-and-operation">General Model Overview and Operation</h4>
<p>At each time step during a drive cycle, the power demand of the drive cycle translates into a vehicle power request. The control strategy of the vehicle determines how much power to request form the fuel cell system and the battery. Then the models supply the power requested to the vehicle that may, or may not, meet the drive cycle power demand due to power limiting effects in the system. </p>
<p>The fuel cell system model includes two major parts: the electrochemistry model and the thermal model. The electrochemistry model relates the operating conditions (temperature, pressure, relative humidity, etc.) to a fuel cell stack voltage and current. The vehicle power request translates into a net power request to the fuel cell system. To start the solution simulation, the iterative solver uses an initial condition that related the net power request to a gross power request. The inputs to the electrochemistry model are the gross power request and the fuel cell stack temperature and the outputs are:</p>
<p>​1. heat generated by the fuel cell reaction within the stack</p>
<p>​2. gross fuel cell system power at the present operating conditions</p>
<p>​3. parasitic power required to run the fuel cell system at the present gross power operating point.</p>
<p>The thermal model uses the result of the electrochemistry model to estimate the operating temperatures in the fuel cell system. In addition, some of the temperatures, eg. fuel cell stack and water reservoir temperatures, are provided by a delayed feedback loop. At each time step, the results of the previous time step (or initial conditions) are used in the thermal model. Using the information of the water balance and temperature from the previous time step and the thermal system characteristics, the thermal model performs mass and energy balances on the fuel cell system components. The outputs of the thermal model are information on </p>
<p>​1. water balance</p>
<p>​2. parasitic power load</p>
<p>​3. cathode operating conditions</p>
<p>​4. humidification and condensation</p>
<p>​5. heat rejection requirements.</p>
<p>With the information of the gross power operating point and the parasitic power required from the electrochemistry and thermal models, a net power operating point is established. During each time step, the iterative solver repeats the electrochemical and thermal calculations to refine the gross power input to meet the requested net power output of the fuel cell system. Internal to the iterative solver, logic steps that refine the solution to different goals in order to meet different operating scenarios. </p>
<p>The fuel cell system model has the ability to converge to three different goals upon a net power request. Goal 1 is to generate the net power requested, goal 2 is to generate a power that has been limited duel to operating conditions and goal 3 is to generate zero gross power. </p>

<p>fc_allowable_temp_rise- the maximum temperature difference across the fuel cell stack</p>
<p>or thermal system characteristics such as</p>
<p>fc_system_coolant_capacity- system cooling medium capacity [liter]<br /> fc_radiator_frontal_area- frontal area of the radiator [m^2]<br /> fc_condenser_frontal_area- frontal area of the condenser [m^2]</p>
