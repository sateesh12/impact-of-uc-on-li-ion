Emissions Standards–ADVISOR
---------------------------

</center>
Compliance with vehicle emissions standards is a critical step in the
vehicle development process.  Given the availability of emissions maps
for your fuel converter, ADVISOR allows you to estimate the engine out
and catalyst out emissions.  By comparing these values to published
federal and state standards it is possible to classify the vehicle in
question and to understand where to focus effort to improve the
emissions classification of a vehicle.  

The developers of the DieselNet website have done an outstanding job of
consolidating and summarizing both federal and state emissions
standards. We recommend that you visit their website for a summary of
current standards.

However, please realize that the official standards are developed and
published by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) at the federal
level and the California Air Resources Board (CARB) at the California
state level.  For more information please visit their respective
websites.
