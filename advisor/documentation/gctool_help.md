###  Overview

The GCTool-based fuel converter will use GCTool as the computation
engine for determining the performance of the fuel converter.  GCTool
can be obtain from Argonne National Laboratory by contacting,

                      Paul Betten \
                       Industrial Technology Development Center \
                      Argonne National Laboratory \
                      9700 S. Cass Avenue \
                      Argonne, IL 60439 \
                      Tel: (630) 252-4962 fax-5230 \
                      e-mail: betten@anl.gov \<betten@anl.gov\> \
 

### Pre-defined

Several pre-defined models have been included for use with ADVISOR. 
Currently, the only design variable that you will be able to modify with
this approach is the peak power output of the fuel cell.  ADVISOR will
call GCTool to build the fuel cell system based on the user inputs and
use that model during simulations.

### User-defined

The user-defined approach allows the user to specify a \*.dat file for
use in simulations.  For more information on how to configure the \*.dat
file for use with ADVISOR please contact tony\_markel@nrel.gov. \
