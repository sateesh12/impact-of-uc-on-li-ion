Custom Load Creation and Modification</b></i></font>

 

    

Overview</b>

Two methods of creating and modifying custom auxiliary loads exist.  The
method available depends on the load selected.  Most loads are defined
by a voltage current relationship (Figure 1).  All other loads are
defined using variations of Figure 2.

The voltage current loads are defined by three currents at three
voltages. The currents, voltages, and descriptive name can be edited. 
The plot illustrates the current-voltage relationship.  For Advisor
alone runs (non-Saber), the average power produced by the voltage
current relationship is used for the simulation.
