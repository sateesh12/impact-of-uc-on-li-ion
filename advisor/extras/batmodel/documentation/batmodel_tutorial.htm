<p><b><font size=+1>Location of Data Files</font></b>
<br>The sample files used in this tutorial are in /advisor/extras/batmodel/sample_files.&nbsp;
There are two types of files:
<ol>
<li>
*.mat files:&nbsp; Saved batmodel files with previously processed data.</li>

<li>
*.dat files:&nbsp; The base data files (generated by the battery tests)
that were processed and assembled into the *.mat files.</li>
</ol>
<b><font size=+1>Overview</font></b>
<br>Batmodel allows you to look at already saved data without processing
it again by clicking on the Results buttons instead of the processing yellow
buttons (e.g. 'VOC vs. SOC').&nbsp; In this tutorial, you will <a href="#Process Files">process
raw data files</a> for an Evercel NiZn 22 Ah battery, <a href="#View Results">view
previously saved results</a>, <a href="#ResultsVsTemp">plot the results
vs. temperature</a> for two different temperatures, and then <a href="#AdvisorModelGen">generate
an ADVISOR battery file</a>.
<p>Commands to be entered at the Matlab prompt are indicate by <b>bold</b>
typeface.&nbsp; Button pushes on the Batmodel screens are indicated by
<font color="#FF0000">red</font>.&nbsp;
Filenames are <i>italicized</i>.
<p><a NAME="View Results"></a><b><font size=+1>View Previously Saved Mat
File Results</font></b>
<br>First, change directories to /advisor/extras/batmodel/sample_files.&nbsp;
If it is not already open, type <b>>> batmodel</b> at the Matlab command
prompt.&nbsp; Select <font color="#FF0000">Load</font> and open the file
named <i>Evercel25_sample.mat</i>.&nbsp; Now you have loaded the battery
file associated with testing at 25<sup>o</sup>C.&nbsp; This file saves
all the battery information under a variable named binf (stands for battery
information).
<p>View the capacity results by selecting <font color="#FF0000">Cap Res</font>.&nbsp;&nbsp;
You should see the following:
<center><a NAME="CapResults"></a><img SRC="tutorial1.gif" height=399 width=412><img SRC="tutorial2.gif" height=399 width=395></center>
For more information on the capacity processing, see <u><a href="batmodel_doc.htm#Capacity">Rate
vs. Capacity Testing</a></u>.
<p>View the VOC results by selecting <font color="#FF0000">Voc Res</font>.&nbsp;
You should see the following:
<center><img SRC="tutorial3.gif" height=395 width=400><img SRC="tutorial4.gif" height=395 width=423></center>
For more information on OCV processing, see <u><a href="batmodel_doc.htm#OCV">OCV
vs. SOC</a></u>.
<p>View the Internal Resistance results by selecting <font color="#FF0000">Rint
Res</font>.&nbsp; You should see the following:
<center><img SRC="tutorial5.gif" height=405 width=453><img SRC="tutorial6.gif" height=576 width=701></center>
For more information on Rint processing, see <u><a href="batmodel_doc.htm#Rint">Internal
Resistance vs. SOC</a></u>.
<p>You can also navigate all of the information available in the variable
binf through the command prompt.&nbsp; For example, at the command prompt,
type <b>>> binf.VOC</b>.&nbsp; You should get the following:
<p>ans =
<blockquote>data_files: {2x1 cell}
<br>path: [1x65 char]

<br>ind: [22x1 double]</blockquote>
You can also look at the results for <i>Evercel32_sample.mat</i> by using
the same process.
<p><a NAME="Process Files"></a><b><font size=+1>Process Raw Data Files</font></b>
<br>To process the raw data files, you process the capacity, the VOC, and
the Rint data files.&nbsp; Note that you need to have the OCV results before
you can process Rint.&nbsp; The capacity processing may occur at any time,
however it is recommended that you process these first, as any information
on the battery that you enter in the 'Data File Information' window (e.g.
which columns time is in) is automatically loaded into the OCV and Rint
'Data File Information' parameters.
<p><b><i>Process Files Already Set Up</i></b>
<br><font color="#FF0000">Load</font> the file named <i>Evercel25_sample.mat</i>.&nbsp;
Select <font color="#FF0000">Chg Path</font> and select <i>Evercel25_sample.mat</i>
again.&nbsp; The path describing the location of the data files is saved
in the binf variable (e.g. binf.peukert.path, binf.VOC.path, and binf.Rint.path).&nbsp;
By selecting 'Chg Path', you are re-defining the path in these three locations
to be the directory of <i>Evercel25_sample.mat </i>(it's associated data
files are also in this path).
<p>Select <font color="#FF0000">Capacity (Peukert).&nbsp; </font>The File
Specification window prompts you to enter the data files you have for capacity
tests.&nbsp; Here, the file <i>EvercelResidualCapacity25C.dat</i> is already
selected.&nbsp; Select <font color="#FF0000">Next</font> and the Data File
Information Window will appear.&nbsp; In our case, we've loaded a file
with this information already entered.&nbsp; If you were processing your
own data, you'd need to input these fields and select the appropriate columns
for your variables through the pull-down menus.&nbsp; Select <font color="#FF0000">Process
Data</font>, and you should see the same results you saw <a href="#CapResults">previously</a>.
<p>Repeat this process for <font color="#FF0000">VOC vs. SOC</font>.&nbsp;
You can repeat for <font color="#FF0000">Internal Resistance </font>as
well, but it may take a long time.&nbsp; Instead, try processing the Internal
Resistance for just the first input file (<i>EvercelC3InternalResistance25CN2.dat</i>).&nbsp;
Note that for the Rint model, if there is limited test data, model points
outside of the test data range are based on a polynomial curve fit to the
test data.&nbsp; This can result in erroneous Rint values (even. negative
values), which is why the user is allowed to change the model values as
edit boxes in the Rint results screen.&nbsp; The user-edited values are
those saved in the binf variable and used as the final parameters.&nbsp;
When processing Rint values, text messages in the command prompt indicate
reasons for throwing out bad current pulse points.
<p><b><i>Process Files From Scratch</i></b>
<br>Now you'll repeat the first few steps starting from scratch, as you
would with new data.&nbsp; Go to the command prompt and clear the workspace
by typing <b>>> clear all; close all; batmodel</b>.&nbsp; From batmodel,
select <font color="#FF0000">Capacity (Peukert)</font>.&nbsp; Select <i>EvercelResidualCapacity25C.dat</i>
to add it to your list of Data Files.&nbsp; Select <font color="#FF0000">Next</font>.&nbsp;
Enter the parameters shown below in the edit boxes, and choose the appropriate
Heading for the Variables from the pull-down menus.
<center>
<p><img SRC="tutorial7.gif" height=463 width=726></center>

<p>Select <font color="#FF0000">Process Data</font>, and you should again
see the same results you saw <a href="#CapResults">previously</a>.&nbsp;
At the command prompt, type <b>>> global binf; binf</b>&nbsp; (binf is
a global variable which is why we first need to specify global binf).&nbsp;
Note that only binf.peukert exists, as you have not yet processed the VOC
and Rint.&nbsp; Select <font color="#FF0000">Save</font> to save your work.&nbsp;
This will save the binf variable, which you can load at a later time to
continue processing of your data.
<p><a NAME="ResultsVsTemp"></a><b><font size=+1>View Results vs. Temperature</font></b>
<br>Once battery data is processed with batmodel for various temperatures
(and saved as mat files), the user can plot the parameter variation with
temperature.&nbsp; To start fresh, type <b>>> clear all; close all; batmodel</b>.&nbsp;
Select <font color="#FF0000">Results vs. Temp</font> and add <i>Evercel25_sample.mat</i>
and <i>Evercel32_sample.mat </i>to your Data File list.&nbsp; Select <font color="#FF0000">Next</font>.&nbsp;
Four plots will appear: capacity, OCV, Rint discharge, and Rint charge.&nbsp;
Data is plotted as well as the model.&nbsp; Here is one of the four plots
you should see:
<center><img SRC="tutorial8.gif" height=411 width=454></center>

<p><a NAME="AdvisorModelGen"></a><b><font size=+1>Generate an ADVISOR Model</font></b>
<br>Once you have a battery file (mat file) for at least one temperature,
you can automatically create an ADVISOR battery file.&nbsp; The data files
used and accuracy/error data from the processing is automatically saved
in the header. You'll need to enter thermal parameters, as well as mass,
and minimum and maximum voltage limits for the battery, and coulombic efficiency
at each temperature.&nbsp; You have to calculate the <a href="../../../documentation/glossary.htm#Coulombic efficiency">coulombic
efficiencies</a>, which can be done by using the capacity tests and the
Ah plots.
<p>Select <font color="#FF0000">ADVISOR model generation </font>and add
<i>Evercel25_sample.mat</i>
and <i>Evercel32_sample.mat </i>to your Data File list.&nbsp; Fill in the
edit boxes as below:
<center>
<p><img SRC="tutorial9.gif" height=757 width=660></center>

<p>Select <font color="#FF0000">Make ADVISOR File</font> and you will create
a new file ESS_NiZn23_sample.m.&nbsp; It's a good idea to open up the file
and double check the parameter values with the plots.&nbsp; Now you're
done!
