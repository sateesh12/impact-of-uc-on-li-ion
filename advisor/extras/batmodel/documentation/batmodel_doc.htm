<b><font size=+1>Processing Battery Test Data</font></b>
<br>Batmodel takes test data, analyzes it, and creates an ADVISOR battery
model. Inputs into Batmodel include descriptions of the test(s) along with
the data files produced by the battery testing data acquisition systems.
The required format of the data files is a header which describes the data
underneath it and the actual data (time, current, voltage, temperature,
etc.) arranged in columns. The header should either have <font color="#FF0000">no
spaces</font> or be <font color="#FF0000">surrounded by quotes</font> (<font color="#FF0000">checking
the 'Quotes around header?' box</font>).
<p>Batmodel 2 divides the processing into two sections:
<ol>
<li>
<a href="#RC proc">RC Model Processing</a> (most recent ADVISOR battery
model)</li>

<li>
<a href="#Rint proc">Internal Resistance - OCV Processing</a></li>
</ol>

<center><img SRC="Image133.gif" BORDER=0 height=515 width=512></center>
<a NAME="RC proc"></a><b>RC Model Processing</b>
<br>This section processes data for RC battery files.&nbsp; It is divided
into three main sections:
<ol>
<li>
Analyze <a href="#OCV">VOC vs. SOC</a> and <a href="#RC test procedures/results">Model
R &amp; C Parameters</a> for a single temperature. Once analyzed and saved,
the results can be viewed without reprocessing. The user can also show
<a href="#ResultsVsTemp">Results

<b><font size=+1>Data Format for Batmodel</font></b>
<br>To generate an ADVISOR RC battery model, two types of tests are performed.
These tests, performed at each desired temperature, are:
<ol>
<li>
Open Circuit Voltage Tests to find V<sub>oc</sub> vs. State of Charge,
and</li>

<li>
HPPC (Hybrid Power Pulse Characterization) tests, as specified by PNGV
Test Procedures.</li>
</ol>
To generate an ADVISOR Rint battery model, three types of tests are performed.
These tests, performed at each desired temperature, are:
<ol>
<li>
Capacity Tests to determine the battery capacity, including residual capacity
tests,</li>

<li>
Open Circuit Voltage Tests to find V<sub>oc</sub> vs. State of Charge,
and</li>

<li>
Current Pulse Tests to find internal resistance as a function of SOC.</li>
</ol>
Required fields for data processing are <font color="#FF0000">Time, Current,
Voltage, Amp Hours, and Temperature</font>.
<p><b><font size=+1>File Specification</font></b>
<br>The File Specification screen comes up when one of the 'Processing'
options (VOC, R &amp; C Params, Capacity, or Rint) from the main screen
is picked. Here the user specifies the data files containing the test data.
The user may save results as one large file, or as many small files.
<center>
<p><img SRC="Image24.gif" height=420 width=705></center>

<p><b><font size=+1>Data File Information</font></b>
<br>Once the test data files have been selected, the user inputs information
about the data files in the Data File Information screen. On the bottom
left the user is presented with the variables needed for data analysis.
The appropriate test data heading is matched to the variable on the left.
Specifying the appropriate headings is made easy with popup menus. Data
can be converted using mathematical expressions if it is not already in
the appropriate units and a sample conversion is provided on the right
for the user to confirm that the proper computation will occur.
<center>
<p><img SRC="Image25.gif" height=469 width=737></center>

<p>After all the information is filled in, the Process Data button is selected.
For the VOC processing, the analysis runs and displays two results figures.
For the 'R and C Params' generation, some more information about the thermal
characteristics and voltage limits of the battery is obtained from the
user.

<p>Batmodel2 creates initial guesses for the 5 parameters in the RC model,
as described in the <a href="../../../documentation/ess_rc.htm">battery
documentation</a>. It then runs an optimization study based on a <font face="Symbol">&plusmn;</font>
10% deviation in these parameters and finds the best fit with the objective
to minimize the average voltage error. The optimization algorithm used
was 'Direct' from University of Michigan. The figure below shows an example
of the voltage (data vs. model) over a single HPPC profile at 71% SOC.
The associated absolute voltage error plotted below shows that the average
error was 0.52%.
<center>
<p><img SRC="Image126.gif" height=420 width=560></center>

<p>The figure below shows the optimization run for a second case. The bottom
graph shows the objective function as it drops with number of iterations.
Note that for each iteration, a direction to travel, in terms of the newly
set values of the parameters, is chosen. For the first iteration, ~5 simulations
were run, and for the last iteration, ~30 simulations were run. In this
case, the optimization dropped the average error from 0.182% to 0.145%.
<center>
<p><img SRC="Image127.gif" height=465 width=539></center>

<p>The optimization is performed for each HPPC profile, and the results
are presented in the Results figure. From here, the user may edit any one
of the parameters. The values for Re, Rc, and Rt vary with SOC in the RC
model, but the values for Cb and Cc are constant. The optimization verifies
this behavior, as the capacitors are constant across SOC values. The final
ADVISOR model uses the average of these capacitor values.

<p><img SRC="Image128.gif" height=609 width=570></center>

<p><br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Once battery data is processed with Batmodel2 for various temperatures,
the user can plot the parameter variation with temperature and then generate
an ADVISOR battery file.
<p><b><u>Rint Model</u></b>
<br><a NAME="Capacity"></a><u>1. Rate vs. Capacity Testing</u>
<p>ADVISOR previously (prior to August, 1999) used this modified form of
the Peukert equation:
<p><img SRC="Image19.gif" height=24 width=153> Equation 1
<p>where <i>I</i> is current (A), <i>Capacity</i> is battery capacity (Ah),
<i>Coeff</i>
is a constant coefficient, empirically derived, and <i>Exp</i> is a constant
exponent, empirically derived. Again, in the current form of the ADVISOR
battery model, Peukert information is not needed.
<p><u>Batmodel Assumptions with the Capacity Tests</u>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>
Amp-hours are assumed to be zero at the start of a distinct test. Multiple
capacity tests and 'residual capacity' tests can be analyzed at the same
time. A 'residual capacity test' discharges the battery at a certain rate,
lets it rest, then discharges again. The latter discharges can be at any
rate.</li>

<li>
The maximum capacity observed during any test is taken as the maximum capacity
of the battery. The capacity is calculated using time and current, and
not assumed to be equal to the A-hrs reported. In general, this allows
for greater accuracy of the capacity calaculation.</li>
</ul>
</ul>
For debugging and for more information, a plot with the points used is
shown to the user. In the graph below, the battery was first discharged
at 6A, then recharged. The second discharge at 30A allows the battery to
rest for 15 minutes, then further discharges it at 6A ('residual capacity
test'). The first capacity is the 'Peukert capacity' and the sum of these
two capacities is the 'residual capacity.'
<center>
<p><img SRC="Image32.gif" height=420 width=560></center>

<p>The figure below shows a typical output for a Peukert/residual capacity
test. The maximum capacity for this battery was ~7 Ah.
<center>
<p><a NAME="_Toc482513753"></a><img SRC="Image33.gif" height=420 width=560></center>

<p><a NAME="OCV"></a><u>2. OCV vs. SOC</u>
<p>NREL performs OCV tests as successive discharges of the battery at 20%
SOC increments and one at 10% SOC, and then rest periods of one hour in
order to determine the OCV as a function of SOC. These tests were normally
run at the C rate, with additional tests performed at lower rates if time
permitted.
<p><u>Batmodel Assumptions with the OCV Tests</u>
<ul>
<li>
Amp-hours are assumed to be zero at the start of a distinct test.</li>

<li>
Amp-hours are used to determine the SOC, in comparison to the maximum Ah
removed.</li>
</ul>
Example plots showing evaluation points and results are shown below.
<center>
<p><img SRC="Image35.gif" height=420 width=560>
<p><img SRC="Image34.gif" height=420 width=560></center>

<p><a NAME="Rint"></a><a NAME="_Toc482513754"></a><a NAME="_Ref482507144"></a><u>3.
Internal Resistance vs. SOC</u>
<p>In ADVISOR, the battery is modeled as an equivalent circuit with no
frequency-dependent resistance, as shown below.
<center>
<p><img SRC="Image20.gif" height=144 width=222></center>

<p>The internal resistance (Rint) parameter in ADVISOR is not the same
as a static impedence (high frequency) measured with an ohm-meter across
a battery’s terminals. ADVISOR’s internal resistance is intended to account
for the full voltage drop experienced by a battery from its equilibrium
open circuit voltage to the terminal voltage that is seen under load. Rint
is assumed to be dependent on both SOC and the direction of current flow.
<p>To determine the internal resistances, a series of pulses of constant
current should be applied to the battery, monitoring the voltage response.
An example of the voltage response to a current pulse is shown below. V<sub>1</sub>,
V<sub>2</sub>, and V<sub>3</sub> in Figure 2 are easily measured, but V<sub>fuzzy</sub>
could not be easily measured. A few assumptions about the battery and model
are used to determine V<sub>fuzzy</sub>. Both the open circuit voltage
and the resistance are assumed to be constant over the pulse period such
that the <font face="Symbol">D</font>V at the beginning of the pulse is
the same at the end of the pulse. Looking at Figure 2, this means that
<font face="Symbol">D</font>V=V<sub>1</sub>-V<sub>fuzzy</sub>=V<sub>3</sub>-V<sub>2</sub>.
The 18 second pulse length was based on two factors: 1) the PNGV Battery
Test Manual suggests an 18 second pulse for resistance characterization,
and 2) 18 seconds was sufficient time for most of the transient behavior
of most cells to die away.
<center>
<p><img SRC="Image21.gif" height=316 width=505></center>

<p>The starting equilibrium voltage of the battery is correlated to SOC,
and the effective resistance of the battery is determined according to
the following equation:
<p><a NAME="_Ref482423578"></a><img SRC="Image22.gif" height=42 width=180>
Equation 2
<p>where V<sub>2</sub> and V<sub>3</sub> are the voltages shown, and I
is the current.
<p>It should be pointed out that although our testing procedure is similar
to the PNGV Battery Test Procedure, it is different. Our procedure is in
line with the method to provide models for ADVISOR.
<p>Typically, Rint testing at NREL consists of discharge pulses, then constant
discharges to take the battery down to a desired SOC, where another pulse
is applied. A similar approach is used for charging. If the discharge rate
is large enough to drop the SOC, no intermediate discharge is used.
<p><u>Batmodel Assumptions with the Rint Tests</u>
<ul>
<li>
Amp-hours are assumed to be zero at the start of a distinct test.</li>

<li>
Rint is calculated using Equation 2 above.</li>

<li>
Data points are not used if the battery reached a voltage limit during
the charge/discharge.</li>
</ul>
The figure below displays the results of an internal resistance analysis.
Actual data is plotted along with a best-fit model. For convenience and
for user manipulation, the curve fit values of resistance corresponding
to various SOC’s are displayed on the right portion of the screen. The
user can vary the curve fit resistance values with the input boxes on the
right side of the results screen and have an automatic update of the average
error computed by:
<p><img SRC="Image26.gif" height=48 width=364><b> </b>Equation 3
<p>By clicking checkboxes, the user also has the option to plot the resistance
data in groups joined by lines where each group has a particular current
associated with it. In some battery technologies, internal resistance data
can depend substantially on the current being drawn.

<p>The figure below displays the time plots of the variables of interest,
e.g. current, voltage and amp-hours. The user can also see which actual
data points were selected for the analysis, and which points were discarded
due to data quality constraints mentioned above.

temperature and then generate an ADVISOR battery file. The plot below shows
an example of the capacity data variation vs. temperature.
