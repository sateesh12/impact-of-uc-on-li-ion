% Data source:
%
% Insight file created from NREL lab test data  
% 		NREL test data from testing entire Insight Battery Pack Jan.2001 (Insight Model Year 2000)
%     
%		Insight pack is reported to be same technology as Japanese Prius (1998) with 20 modules instead of 40
%          Battery Type: NiMH Spiral Wound
%				Nominal Cell Voltage: 1.2V
%				Total Cells: 120 (6 cells x 20 modules)  (40 modules for Japanese Prius)
%				Nominal Voltage: 144 V (288 V for Japanese Prius)
%				Published Capacity: 6.5 Ah
%
%    Tests performed at 25 deg C following the PNGV Hybrid Pulse Power Characterization (HPPC) Procedure
