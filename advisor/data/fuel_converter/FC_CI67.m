% Data source:  Data collected from Neumann, Karl-Heinz; Kuhlmeyer, Manfred; Pohle, Jurgen.
% "The New 1.9 L TDI Diesel Engine With Low Fuel Consumption and Low Emissions
% from Volkswagen and Audi," est. year of publication: 1993.
%
% Data confidence level:  
%
% Notes:  
% Maximum Power 67 kW @ 4000 rpm.
% Peak Torque 182 Nm @ 2300 rpm.
% Effective mean working pressure and torque from reference:
%		66 kW @ 4000 rpm (1)
%		182 Nm @ 2300 rpm
% 
% Observed maximum effective mean working pressure:
%		12.4 bar @ 2300 rpm
%		11.0 bar @ 4000 rpm
%
% From (1),
%		(66 kW)/((4000 rpm)*(2*pi rad/rev)*(60 sec/min)) ==> 157.5 Nm @ 4000 rpm
%
% Thus,
%		@ 4000 rpm, (157.6 Nm)/(11 bar) = 14.3 Nm/bar
%		@ 2300 rpm, (182 Nm)/(12.4 bar) = 14.7 Nm/bar
%
% Therefore use 14.5 Nm/bar as the conversion factor for converting effective mean 
% working pressure to torque.
