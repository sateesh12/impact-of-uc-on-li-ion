% REVISION HISTORY
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 1/26/01:tm created from FC_SI41_emis
% 01/31/01: vhj added fc_cold=0, added cold map variables, added +eps to avoid dividing by zero
% 02/26/01: vhj added variable definition of fc_o2_map (used in NOx absorber emis.)
% 07/30/01: mpo moved the definition of fc_o2_map down in file so that fc_fuel_map is defined before fc_o2_map
% 7/30/01:tm added user definable mass scaling function mass=f(fc_spd_scale,fc_trq_scale,fc_base_mass,fc_acc_mass,fc_fuel_mass)
