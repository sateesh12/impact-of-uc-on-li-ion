% Data source:
% Biais F., Langry P. "Optimization of a permanent magnet traction motor 
% for electric vehicle", 
% Proceedings 15th Electric Vehicle Symposium, Brussels, October 1998.

% Data confidence level:  Good: data from a published paper

% Notes: Efficiency/loss data appropriate for a rated voltage system (voltage 
%        was not given in the source paper). The efficiency map appears from 
%        the paper to be 'calculated' rather than 'measured'. It results from 
% 			an optimization process of an existing water-cooled traction drive 
% 			provided with Nd-Fe-B magnets. 
%			The study has been carried out in collaboration with the French 
%			automaker RENAULT.
