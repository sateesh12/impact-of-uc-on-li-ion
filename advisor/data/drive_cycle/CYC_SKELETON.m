% SPEED AND KEY POSITION vs. time
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% SPEED: load variable 'cyc_mph', 2 column matrix with time in the first column, speed in mph
% in the second column.  Most cycle files load a *.mat file, which is a matlab file 
% you can creat by issuing the command 'save cyc_skeleton cyc_mph' 
% We use the *.mat file to conserve space and load the data quicker.
% If you save your data to a *.mat file, use this command to load: 'load CYC_SKELETON.mat'

% The key on is set to 'off' if you want to do a vehicle soak, such as in the 
% Federal Test Procedure between bags 2 and 3.  It should be defined at the same time

% Size of 'window' used to filter the trace with centered-in-time averaging;
% higher numbers mean more smoothing and less rigorous following of the trace.

%if a variable grade is desired then cyc_grade has to contain distance and grade info.
%the first column of cyc_grade would be the distance in meters and the second column would
%be the grade at that distance.
cyc_elevation_init=1500; %the initial elevation in meters.

% REVISION HISTORY
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% 8/26/99:ss created for users to have an example of a cycle file
% 11/3/99:ss updated version to 2.21
% 8/11/00:kw modified to be more useful for users to create their own cycle files
% 7/02/01:mpo added variable cargo-mass functionality
% 8/09/01:mpo added if..end statement to ensure cyc_mph is defined for elapsed time = 0 (i.e., initial conditions)
% 8/20/01: mpo added special case code to reset gb_shift_delay if changed by cyc_coast
